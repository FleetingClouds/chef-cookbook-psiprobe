Description
===========

Obtains and installs the Psi Probe war file in TomCat.

Source code available here : https://github.com/FleetingClouds/chef-cookbook-psiprobe


Preamble
========

This is my first attempt at a simple Chef cookbook, so please expect some quirks.

It is only tested on TomCat 6, only as installed by the default TomCat Cookbook, and only on Ubuntu 11.04.

It uses more shell scripting than it should, where Ruby would probably be just as capable, if not more so.

Comments and pulls are encouraged, very much so, please.


Requirements
============

Application
-----------

* TomCat 6 (tested)
* Any other Tomcat understood by Psi Probe ought to be ok.


Platform
--------

* Ubuntu 11.04  (Tested)
* Any other platform that supports TomCat ought to be ok.


Usage
=====

If you are using the default tomcat cookbook on Ubuntu you can run with the defaults.

You have the option to set the attribute  default[:psiprobe][:define_manager] = "true".  That will cause the recipe to edit the file tomcat-user.xml adding a "manager" role, if there is not one already, and adding a "manager" user you specify with   default[:psiprobe][:manager_uid]   and   default[:psiprobe][:manager_pwd]
